# The server configuration is set by a `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ file, ``config.yml``.
# A number of parameters are set here, and read by the :mod:`WorkflowWebTools.serverconfig`:
#
# - The webmaster name and email determines who the registration emails are sent from.
# - The host name and port tell where to serve the cherrypy application if using the CherryPy server.
# - The data locations are split up into
#
#   - Historic information
#   - Location to fetch the current errors
#   - Location to fetch the current errors' explanations
#   - If any of these files are behind Shibboleth,
#     cookie_file, cookie_pem, and cookie_key should be listed under data too.
#     These keys are used as kwargs for :py:func:`CMSToolBox.get_json`
#
# - Valid registration email domains and specific whitelisted emails
# - Actions stores the number of days to check the submission history for actions requested
# - Clustering parameters 
#
# See :mod:`WorkflowWebTools.clusterworkflows` for more details on the clustering parameters.
